  <div id="installation-ubuntu" class="sub-section">
    <a name="installation-ubuntu"></a>
    <span class="heading">Installing on Ubuntu</span>

    <p>
      <em>Step 1</em>
    </p>
    <div class="image"><img src="user_guide_images/ubuntu_install_1.png"></div>
    <p>
      You will have been provided with the ZIP file 'IanFosterServices_WorkManager.zip'. Open this file. You will see
      two folders: 'ubuntu' and 'windows'.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Step 2</em>
    </p>
    <div class="image"><img src="user_guide_images/ubuntu_install_2.png"></div>
    <p>
      Drag the 'ubuntu' folder into a location of your choice (the Desktop was used in the provided image). Open the
      folder and double click the file 'install.sh'. A dialog will appear, asking whether you want to run the file or
      display its contents. Click 'Run'. A dialog asking for your password should appear. Enter your password when this
      happens.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Step 3</em>
    </p>
    <div class="image"><img src="user_guide_images/ubuntu_install_3.png"></div>
    <p>
      The program should have installed successfully. Open the Ubuntu Dash (or the applications menu if you are not
      using Gnome, KDE, etc. instead of the Unity interface). You should be able to find the application if you navigate
      to the 'Installed' applications section, or start to type in 'Ian Foster Services Work Manager' in the 'Search
      Applications' input field. If you are not using the Unity interface, then the program will be able to be found in
      the 'Office' category of your applications menu.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Step 4</em>
    </p>
    <div class="image"><img src="user_guide_images/ubuntu_install_4.png"></div>
    <p>
      Once you have found the program, you can run it just like any other application installed on your computer. Do the
      initial set up and you will be able to use the program (for more information on the initial set up, go to the
      <a href="#firstTimeRun">First Time Run</a> section). You may now delete 'IanFosterServices_WorkManager.zip' and
      the 'ubuntu' folder.
    </p>

  </div>

  <div id="installation-windows" class="sub-section">
    <a name="installation-windows"></a>
    <span class="heading">Installing on Windows</span>

    <p>
      <em>Step 1</em>
    </p>
    <div class="image"><img src="user_guide_images/windows_install_1.png"></div>
    <p>
      You will have been provided with the ZIP file 'IanFosterServices_WorkManager.zip'. Open this file. You will see
      two folders: 'ubuntu' and 'windows'.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Step 2</em>
    </p>
    <div class="image"><img src="user_guide_images/windows_install_2.png"></div>
    <p>
      Drag the 'windows' folder into a location of your choice (the Desktop was used in the provided image) and open it.
      Firstly, you will need to run either the 'vcredist_x64' installer if you are using a 64-bit Windows installation
      or the 'vcredist_x86' installer if you are using a 32-bit Windows installation. This must be installed in order
      for the program to be able to send emails correctly. If the installer gives the option to either 'Repair' or
      'Remove', choose the 'Repair' option (on most systems this will not occur, so do not worry if you are not given
      this option). If the installer asks to restart your computer, let it restart.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Step 3</em>
    </p>
    <div class="image"><img src="user_guide_images/windows_install_3.png"></div>
    <p>
      Once you have installed either 'vcredist_x64' or 'vcredist_x86', run the 'IanFosterServices_WorkManger_Installer'
      file in the 'windows' folder. You will then be guided through the process of installing the program on your
      computer.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Step 4</em>
    </p>
    <div class="image"><img src="user_guide_images/windows_install_4.png"></div>
    <p>
      Verify that the program has been installed correctly by checking that there is an 'Ian Foster Services Work
      Manager' icon on your Desktop and also an 'Ian Foster Services Work Manager' listing in the Start Menu.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Step 5</em>
    </p>
    <div class="image"><img src="user_guide_images/windows_install_5.png"></div>
    <p>
      You can run the program just like any other application installed on your computer. Do the initial set up and you
      will be able to use the program (for more information on the initial set up, go to the
      <a href="#firstTimeRun">First Time Run</a> section). You may now delete 'IanFosterServices_WorkManager.zip' and
      the 'windows' folder.

  <p>
    Upon running the program for the first time, the settings screen will be displayed. Fill in the required details,
    and then the click 'Save settings' button. For more information about the settings screen, go to the
    <a href="#settings">Settings</a> section.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a dialog that looks like this
    <div class="image">
      <img src="user_guide_images/firstTimeRun_fileAlreadyExists.png">
    </div>
    is displayed, then click the 'Don't move file and keep existing file' button.

  <p>
    After the settings have been saved, the home screen will be displayed. For more information about the home screen,
    go to the <a href="#usingTheProgram-homeScreen">Home Screen</a> section.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is recommended that the first thing you do is enter the UK VAT rate history into the database. You can do this
    by clicking 'VAT Rates' in the 'Management' menu. For more information about managing VAT rates, go to the
    <a href="#usingTheProgram-managingVatRates">Managing VAT Rates</a> section.

    This is the settings screen. You will have access to this screen when the program is run for the first time, and can
    be accessed from the home screen at any time. For more information about the home screen, go to the

    </div>
    <p>
      The directory settings allow you to specify the folder where you would like files generated by the program to be
      saved. It is recommended that you choose a folder that you can remember and have easy access to. If you change a
      directory setting, the files in the old folder will automatically be moved to the new location for you.
    </p>

    <div id="settings-directories-database" class="sub-sub-section">
      <a name="settings-directories-database"></a>
      <span class="heading">Database</span>
      <p>
        The database directory is the folder that contains the main database for the program. This folder should
        be secure, as it is the location where all of your customer and job records will be stored.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="settings-directories-backups" class="sub-sub-section">
      <a name="settings-directories-backups"></a>
      <span class="heading">Backup</span>
      <p>
        The backup directory is the folder that contains all of your backups. It is recommended that this folder
        is on an external device, such as an external hard disk, or is synchronised with an online cloud service. For
        more information about backups, go to the <a href="#backups">Backups</a> section.

      <a name="settings-directories-pdfs"></a>
      <span class="heading">PDF</span>
      <p>
        The PDF directory is the folder that contains all of the PDF files generated by the program; the invoices,
        receipts and reports. This folder should be in a location that is easily accessible, such as your 'Documents'
        or 'My Documents' folder, because you will likely want to view these PDFs at a later date, or print them out
        so that hard copies can be filed or sent to customers.

    </div>
    <p>
      By using the 'Change Password' form, you can set a password that will be required by the program on start up in
      order for the user to gain access. This is useful if the program is installed on a shared computer, and you would
      like to keep the data safe from other users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passwords must be at least four characters long. It is recommended that you use at least eight characters and that
      you use capital letters, numbers and special characters in order to make your password more difficult to guess.

  <div id="settings-email" class="sub-section">
    <a name="settings-email"></a>
    <span class="heading">Email</span>
    <p>
      A useful feature of this program is that it allows you to send emails to customers. You can send invoices,
      receipts and even reminders if they have not paid for your work in a while. The email settings allow you to
      customise the content of these emails and to specify which email account to send the emails from.
    </p>

    <div id="settings-email-content" class="sub-sub-section">
      <a name="settings-email-content"></a>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="user_guide_images/settings_email_content.png">
      </div>
      <p>
        The program allows you to customise the subject and body of the invoice, receipt and reminder emails. To choose
        which email content you would like to modify, select the relevant tab to the left.

      </div>
      <p>
        The Email Host settings must be filled in correctly in order for the program to send emails.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 'Username' field requires your email account username (this is typically the first part of your email
        address, before the '@' sign).
      </p>
      <p>
        The 'Password' field requires the password for your email account.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 'Host address' field requires the address of the outgoing server for emails (it usually looks like
        'smtp.myemailhost.com', or similar).
      </p>
      <p>
        The 'Host port' field requires the port number for <strong>SSL</strong> connections to the outgoing email server
        (this is usually 465, which the program defaults to). If you do not know the details for the outgoing server of
        your email host, please visit the website of the host (which is usually the second part of your email address,
        after the '@' sign).

      The menu consists of three sections. The <em>Management</em> section allows you to visit different places in the
      program to manage jobs, customers, expenses and VAT history. The <em>Reports</em> section allows you to generate
      monthly financial reports and also provides the <em>Report Wizard</em>, which allows you to generate a report for

    Keeping backups of your data is extremely important. Thankfully, the program takes care of backups for you, so you
    do not need to worry about making backups yourself. Is is recommended that you have the program settings set so
    that backups are made to an external devise or to a folder that is synchronised with an online cloud service.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the beginning of every week, the program creates a new folder in the backup directory (specified in the settings)
    with the year and week number. Every time the program is closed, it copies files in the database folder
    (specified in the settings) and puts them in the current week's backup folder. This assures that the latest data is
    backed up, while at the same time creating a backup history.
  </p>
  <p>
    If your database files are corrupted, deleted, or lost in any other way, then copy the backup files for the latest
    week into the folder that the program is stored in. You will then be able to continue using the program with minimal
    data loss.

    <strong>An error message 'Could not open file something.dat' appears. How do I fix this?</strong>
    <p>
      Either the program could not find the file or the file being used by another program. First, make sure that the
      file is present in the database folder that is specified in the settings. If the file is present, then make sure
      that the file is not being used by another program. If the file is not present in the database folder, then
      either copy the latest version of the file from the backups folder into the database folder, or restart the
      program (the program will automatically recreate the missing database file for you on start up).

      When sending an email, the 'Sending emails' dialog box pops up and doesn't go away after waiting a long time.
      How do I fix this?
    </strong>
    <p>
      There is likely to be a problem with your email host settings, or with the customer's email address that the email
      is being set to. To check your email host settings, select the 'Email Host' tab on the settings screen. If your
      email host settings are correct, check the email address of the customer. Once you have verified that these are
      correct, close the program, making sure to cancel the sending of the emails. Then reopen the program and send the
      emails again.

    <strong>How can I print hard copies of invoices, receipts and reports?</strong>
    <p>
      To print out a PDF generated by the program, you need to open the PDF in your computer's PDF reader, and then
      print from there (typically using the keys Ctrl+P or by selecting 'Print' from the 'File' menu). To find the PDFs,
      navigate to the folder where the PDFs are stored (which was specified in the settings).
    </p>
    <p>
      For specific advice on generating and viewing invoices or receipts, go to the
      <a href="#usingTheProgram-managingJobs-invoices">Invoices</a> or
      <a href="#usingTheProgram-managingJobs-receipts">Receipts</a> sections, respectively. For advice on generating and
      viewing reports, go to the <a href="#usingTheProgram-reports">Reports</a> section.

    <strong>How can I synchronise the program across multiple computers?</strong>
    <p>
      To have the database, backups, settings and/or PDFs synchronised across multiple computers or operating systems,
      you will need to specify a folder that is automatically synchronised across multiple computers in the settings
      for database/backup/PDF directories (for more information about folder settings, go to the
      <a href="#settings-directories">Directory Settings</a> section). On all of the computers that the program is
      installed on, the settings will need to point to this folder. It is recommended that you set up all of your
      computers for this before using the program fully, so that there is no risk of data accidentally being
      overwritten. If you have the database stored in a synchronised folder, make sure that when setting up a new
      installation of the program on another computer, you choose 'Delete file and keep existing file' if a 'File
      Already Exists' dialog appears when setting the directory settings to point to the synchronised folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      A recommended service for synchronising files across multiple computers is Dropbox. Please visit
      <a href="https://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">www.dropbox.com</a> for more information.
